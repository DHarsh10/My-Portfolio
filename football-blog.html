                Football — "The beautiful game". As the motto says it's really a beautiful game. For some people it's just a game where some group of people chase the ball, pass the ball to each other and hit the ball inside the post, but for most of the people it's a life, it's an addiction, it's an emotional roller coaster, and it's everything. I played it only few times since my college days, but I hardly miss a game when it comes to my favorite club.

            <h3>My Club</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, you heard it right — "my favorite club" and that is "FC Barcelona". That's where everything was started for me with this game. One of the Spanish giants, The Catalans, The Blaugranas(blue and claret), Barça these are the few nicknames. The club's motto is "Mes Que Un Club" which means "More than a club" and it's really more than a club because the supporters own and operate the club unlike other clubs across the world. During 90s because of thousands and thousands of fans, most of the people seated on the wall at the very top of the stands. Over a period of time people started to call them "Culers" or "cules" which refers to those fans seated on the wall. Even today people call Barcelona fans Cules.

            <h3>As a fan</h3>
            <p>
                As I said before I used to watch most of the games of Bacelona, which means more than 90%. Most of the games were at the midnight for South Asian time zone, but still we used to wake up midnight or used to stay till late night just to watch our team. The excitement of late night kick-offs is unmatchable. As a fan I experienced everything, from dominating the football world for half a decade to one of the most declining clubs in the recent days. From undoubtable kings of football world to embarrassing defeats. But in between this wonderful journey I met countless people/ cules including my mates to unknowns across the country, so much bonding. This club really united us in many ways. Even though most of us never saw each other, we know each other, we discuss each other, we talk each other. This is what this club and this game did to us.

                Sports is an important aspect in most of the individual's life. It teaches something to the people in one or another way. How to be strong in difficult times, How to be confident and tackle the problems, How to overcome against the strong minds as an underdog, passion, emotion, love etc. these are just few of the examples. Every sport teaches the same thing, but it's individuals subjective opinion to follow which one with intent.
