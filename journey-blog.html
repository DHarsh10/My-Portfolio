            <p>First thing is Thanking you for showing some sort of interest to read my messy writing. As I said before, I am Harshith D. 2021 batch passed out Engineering student in Dayananda Sagar Academy Of Technology And Management specialized in Electronics and communications with the CGPA of 7.92. I completed my Schooling and college in Davanagere and Shivamogga district with the percentage of 92 and 70 respectively. This is all about my basic academic history so far.</p>

            <h3>Engineering Days</h3>
            <p>
                It was never an option for me to end up as an Engineering student. But it is what it is, sometimes you have to accept the reality especially when your mind is in messy situation.  Even though my core was Electronics and communications, my interest turned out to be a web developer when I was in 7th semester. Not because most of the students follows the trend and choose this path, but one of my friend told me about this thing and after tried to learn it for days and days I found it interesting. That's where I started to research about it on different online platforms to know about HTML, The beautiful world of CSS, JavaScript, and it's library React.

            <p>
                But some health issues affected my academics as well as career related issues during my 3rd and 4th year of my college days. I never thought about my career and attended any placements related things during that period. It was nearly impossible for me to even think about anything, not only career and academics at that time. But I am slowly recovering from those physical and mental horrors and trying to forget everything which was happened in order to focus on present as well as future.
            </p>


            <h3>What's Next?</h3>
            <p>
                Even though I want to learn Full Stack development to the core in the coming days, My interests lies in the designing part. I like to spend more and more time on designing even if it's unnecessary most of the time. So I started to learn the Frontend and still learning and trying to master it one day. It would be even more fruitful if I find the perfect job which helps me to grow on the field of my interest. It doesn't mean I stop to learn Full Stack, but definitely it's going to take some time to learn it to the core.
